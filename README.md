# Telegram Bots Sandbox

This repository contains various small-scale Telegram bot projects and examples. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with Telegram bot functionalities, demonstrating specific use cases, and creating quick solutions.

## Structure
Any bot is stored in a separate directory and includes:
- `bot.py` — the main file for the bot's logic.
- `README.md` — a description of the bot's functionality and usage.

- Optionally, each directory may have more files with a detailed description of its use in the classic file `README.md`.

## Examples Included
